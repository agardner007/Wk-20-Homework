          <p>This was an imagine project, with user research to discover what works and what doesn't and then make the necessary changes to improve the navigation and look of the website.</p>
          <p>As a bootcamp project, I worked to identify what adjustments could be made to improve the website home page. This was a solo project. Going through the user research steps of usability testing, and affinity diagram to identify likes, dislikes, and suggestions. Even used some card sorting to identify navigation from users perspective.</p>

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The biggest problem with the website is the not-so-important information on the homepage and the navigation at the top of the home page is not really used as it should or could be. So the goal was to streamline the homepage layout and simplify menus to make the website easier to navigate. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>The AB testing proved to be a hit with the users. The goal was achieved based on what users had to say during the AB test. When the users needed to find specific topics to search or log in to their profile the user's comments were "so simple now" and "what a great design, way easier to find what I need". </p>

          <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
          <p>To make sure that the siteâ€™s information architecture is aligned with user expectations, had 2 card-sorting sessions using Miro. The goal was to find intuitive groupings for the existing main navigation and footer navigation. After organizing the data, I ended up with 5 clearly defined main categories for the main navigation and 4 for the footer navigation. The structure of the card sorting made more sense to the look and feel of the navigation.</p>

          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <p>Using Figma, I translated my first sketches into low-fidelity wireframes. Then, I improved them by adding a few relevant stock images and building the footer navigation and side menu. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough for some user testing. Based on the test results, I made a few iterations and moved on to creating high-fidelity prototypes. </p>

          <h3>UI Design</h3>
          <p>Once the usability issues were resolved, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. My goal was to create a visual identity that was to achieve the original goal as it aligns with the finding through the testing. The stunning image provided by the unsplash.com plugin along with the logo provided by the original website. A dark overlay was used on the image area below the text for it to stand out and not get washed out. The UI was designed to be used on desktop and mobile. </p>

          <h3>Mobile UI Design</h3>
          <p>Once the website redesign was complete I took on the mobile askect of the design. The result is having the website be responsive to work on all mobile devices flawlessly. The keeping it simple continued as I focused to include all the options in the side hamburger menu as well as the main menue hamberger. Super simple and clean to keep confusion to a minumum.  </p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>As for the next step if I was to continue the project. I would go through the other layers of the website and make sure the site carries the framework of the layout the same. There is a lot of information that the hawaii.gov website provides the people of Hawaii and the website would be pretty dang cool to have the cohesiveness of a consistent design throughout its layers of pages. I have some advice for the design team, your website is for the state of Hawaii, make it cool and beautiful, keep it simple, do your user tests, and research for what is best for the users.</p>

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>When I started this project I had a pretty good vision of what I wanted to get across and I am pretty pleased with the result. I think it's beautiful and easier to navigate for the user. A fun lesson that I learned from this project is that people really can make a difference. When given the chance the different insight users give is valuable. I need to get out of my comfort zone a bit more and follow the research results to get great results. Having the chance to design is always a bonus no matter what. The experience matters whether the results are great or small in anyone's eyes.</p>
